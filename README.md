# skyMatch

Project Overview

SkyMatch is a web-based platform designed to connect airlines looking to rent aircraft and crew with those offering these resources. This repository contains the frontend implementation of the platform, focusing on providing a user-friendly interface to search, view, and filter aircraft and crew options. Future iterations will include a separate backend project to handle data management and server-side functionality.

Features

	•	Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
	•	Aircraft Listings: View detailed aircraft profiles with essential information such as type, capacity, and availability.
	•	Search & Filters: Easily search for aircraft and crew using criteria like location, availability, and capacity.
	•	User Dashboard: A dedicated area where users can view available options and track their activity on the platform.

Technologies Used

	•	React / Next.js: For building the frontend UI components and routing.
	•	Tailwind CSS: For streamlined and responsive styling.
	•	JavaScript / TypeScript: For component logic and type safety.

Future Development

	•	Backend Integration: A separate backend project will handle data storage, authentication, and business logic.
	•	API Endpoints: The frontend will connect to a RESTful API for data retrieval and updates.
	•	Booking Management: Adding functionality for submitting and managing rental requests.
